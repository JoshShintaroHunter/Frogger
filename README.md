# --Frogger--

This game is very simple, upon loading enemy and player icons are generated.

Using the arrow keys the player will attempt to move their icon to the otherside of the lane of crossing bugs, if the player comes into contact with a bug they are reset to the starting positon, if they make it accross they are reset to the starting postion.
